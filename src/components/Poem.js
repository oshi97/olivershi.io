			I write to you in consequence,
			A message of import
			O'er blue ridged hills and sandy dunes,
			Comes news I must transport

			A classical fable of a goat in the alps
			Who spotted a stalk of corn
			With great excitement he climbed all the way over
			And stuck it onto his horn

			This goat was mightily 
			Still quite excitingly
			With his newly skewered prize
			Yet in the distance
			And even better delightenment
			Met his beardly eyes

			In no small distance
			Our hero could see
			a watermelon
			Jiggling in the breeze

			Without second thought
			And no time to consume
			He leapt his way over
			Corn still adamantly skewered
			
			the watermelon
			dancing under his knees
			brought tears to his eyes
      that nobody could see
      
      Now, dear reader, you may start to wonder
      With such a strange a rhyme
			Whatever the klucker is this ridiculous pucker?
			Trying to tell me here?

			My dear consumer, oh, get out of your stupor!
			These issues are one and the same.
			The issue that's missed is you've not bothered to wander
			Your brain through the woods of a joyous wonderment
			On this colorful, blunderful, 
			summerful day

			In the actual fable
			what would actually fester
			is that the goat would end up
			with just the last of his treasure

			For the goat would find himself
			at each new encounter
			Perhaps with a new trophy
			But always losing the latter

			But in real life, these cycles never end
			Till we find ourselves all shriveled
			and dead

			Traditionally we would store 
			into our brains
			The new things that we graciously
			learn each day
			
			But when there's too much
			Overstimulation
			We found ourselves put into a situation

			We feel if we don't act at this second
			The things that we see
			Will not ours be
			Yet funnily enough 
			if this belief we follow
			We soon find ourselves
			With our brains quite hollow

			And the reason for all of this
			Is really quite selfish
			It's so I can remember
			A least, some, of each day's rubbish

			For when you ask a question
			on a colorful wonderful day
			It ought to be answered, and remember
			I'd like to think it's this way

			And here you might find
			Some of the debris
			That washes up on the shores
			From each day's thinkings

			And if you've made it to the end
			of this dreadfully long poem
			Which I regretfully say
			I've dragged longer than a boa

			I thank you for 
			reaching the send
			but implore you to believe
			that learning never ends
