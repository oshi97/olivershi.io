					I write to you in consequence,
					A message of import
					O'er blue ridged hills and sandy dunes,
					Comes news I must transport

					The internet, is corrupting our youth!
					This idea is hard to deny

					Put perhaps our wizened, shriveled haggard accusers
					Should stop to think how all of these users
					Have found themselves to be thoughtless consumers?

					Now, dear reader, you may start to wonder
					Whatever the klucker is this ridiculous pucker?
					Trying to tell me here?
					It seems quite irrelevant
					And frankly sounds like a celibate
					Please, good sir, the point?

					My dear consumer, oh, get out of your stupor!
					These issues are one and the same.
					The issue that's missed is you've not bothered to wander
					Your brain through the woods of a joyous wonderment
					On this colorful, blunderful, 
					summerful day

					A classical fable of a goat in the alps
					Who spotted a stalk of corn
					With great excitement he climbed all the way over
					And stuck it onto his horn

					This goat was mightily 
					Still quite excitingly
					With his newly skewered prize
					Yet in the distance
					And even better delightenment
					Met his beardly eyes

					In no small distance
					Our hero could see
					a watermelon
					Jiggling in the breeze

					Without second thought
					And no time to consume
					He leapt his way over
					Corn still adamantly skewered
					
					the watermelon
					dancing under his knees
					brought tears to his eyes
					that nobody could see

					In the actual fable
					what would actually fester
					is that the goat would end up
					with just the last of his treasure

					For the goat would find himself
					at each new encounter
					Perhaps with a new trophy
					But always losing the latter

					But in real life, these cycles never end
					Till we find ourselves all shriveled
					and dead

					Traditionally we would store 
					into our brains
					The new things that we graciously
					learn each day
					
					But when there's too much
					Overstimulation
					We found ourselves put into a situation

					We feel if we don't act at this second
					The things that we see
					Will not ours be
					Yet funnily enough 
					if this belief we follow
					We soon find ourselves
					With our brains quite hollow

					And the reason for all of this
					Is really quite selfish
					It's so I can remember
					A least, some, of each day's rubbish

					For when you ask a question
					on a colorful wonderful day
					It ought to be answered, and remember
					I'd like to think it's this way

					And here you might find
					Some of the debris
					That washes up on the shores
					From each day's thinkings

					And if you've made it to the end
					of this dreadfully long poem
					Which I regretfully say
					I've dragged longer than a boa

					I thank you for 
					reaching the send
					but implore you to believe
					that learning never ends
