#### Getting Started
Because I am a forgetful fuck

```bash
npm run dev
```
Site will be served at https://localhost:3000

#### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

If throws error that looks like it is using python2 instead of python3, run sheets.py separately.

npm-run-all is used because Windows is special.
